Kali Linux is used for advanced penetration testing and security auditing. It contains several hundred tools which are geared towards various information security functions, such as security research, computer forensics and reverse engineering. The current kernel includes around 600 apps total. Here are just a few: Nmap, or "Netowrk Mapper"; Lynis, a compliance testing and auditing program; and Aircrack-ng, a collection of tools to assess WiFi security.
Kali is the child of Backtrack, the first Linux distribution developed for ethical hacking and security informatics. Backtrack included redundant tools which served the same purpose, rendering it jampacked with unnecessary programs and utilities. Kali Linux was developed to simplify the task of ethical hacking.
While it is very useful for its intended purpose, Kali is not safe out-of-the-box as a primary machine. With sufficient sysadmin savvy, it can be hardened to be safe for primary use, but a beginner should only use it on a virtual machine or ARM. A good rule of thumb would be that Kali is good for testing other operating systems, and a poor choice when others are testing your operating system. It is also worth noting that the tools included on Kali are not intended for "messing around" on legitimate external networks, unless you are an authorized user; to assume otherwise could very well bring the police to your door. Use it by all means, but only attack your own devices or networks to learn about penetration.
