Kali Linux is used for advanced penetration testing and security auditing. It contains several hundred tools which are geared towards various information security functions, such as security research, computer forensics and reverse engineering. The current kernel includes around 600 apps total. Here are just a few: Nmap, or "Netowrk Mapper"; Lynis, a compliance testing and auditing program; and Aircrack-ng, a collection of tools to assess WiFi security.
Kali is the child of Backtrack, the first Linux distribution developed for ethical hacking and security informatics. Backtrack included redundant tools which served the same purpose, rendering it jampacked with unnecessary programs and utilities. Kali Linux was developed to simplify the task of ethical hacking.
